              Just like larger companies, small businesses like yours need
              advanced technology to operate efficiently and to compete
              effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources to support
              an increasingly complex IT environment may not. In many small
              businesses, IT resources are scarce, and can be quickly
              overwhelmed with the day-to-day responsibilities of keeping the IT
              infrastructure that the business depends on up and running.
            </p>
            <h5>The problem small businesses face</h5>
            <p>
              If you fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups,
              patches and security, the odds are that you'll face an IT outage
              or another problem down the road that will negatively impact your
              business. For instance, if your e-mail server, customer
              relationship management system, financial application or network
              goes down unexpectedly, you face substantial productivity and
              revenue losses as a result.
